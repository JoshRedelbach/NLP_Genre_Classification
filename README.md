# Finding the Genre of Movie Plots

This group project in the course *Natural Language Processing* had the goal to estimate a filmâ€™s genre using its plot, title, country of origin, and director. A combination of a transformer model and a Support Vector Classifier was designed and implemented in Python to perform this task.


## Structure

The code is given as a Jupyther Notebook in [reviews.ipynb](/reviews.ipynb). The model was trained based on [train.txt](/train.txt) and tested using [test_no_labels.txt](/test_no_labels.txt). The estimated labels are given in [results.txt](/results.txt).

The results are summarized and interpreted in the [report](/report.pdf).
